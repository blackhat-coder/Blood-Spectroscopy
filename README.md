> [Competition](https://zindi.africa/competitions/bloodsai-blood-spectroscopy-classification-challenge) hosted by bloods.ai on [Zindi](https://zindi.africa)

## Overview
Traditionally we do blood analysis by collecting blood samples from patients and perform different tests on the samples. In this competition, you will help scientists from bloods.ai to make progress towards non-invasive blood analyses.
For this purpose, you build machine learning models that can classify the level of specific chemical compounds in samples from their spectroscopic data. In simple terms when we direct a beam of light towards a sample, the light is partially absorbed and/or reflected based on the sample's molecular structure (different chemical compounds present).
