NIR Spectrometry Efficacy and Tools

- stable NIR-enabled devices

decompose beer-lambert law:
- quantity of light absorbed is directly proportional to the
  concentration of the substance.

METHODOLOGIES
- ANN
- CNNs

Regularization Techniques
- Bayesian regularized ANN(BRANN) [can be applied]

Patented Solution:
In order to achieve an NIR scan most reflective of the associated
blood sample, both the scan and sample are collected within 15mins
of one another to  mitigate metabolic variations occurring between
collections and limit variation within the dataset.

Number of NIR channels and exposure time affect analysis results

Compromised results are discarded(readings impacted by temperature)
inconsistencies and other variables


SPECTROSCOPY
spectroscopy is the interaction between light and matter


if a compound has a high absorption rate at that wavelength,

# Things to try
- remove id's where average temperature is high
- add, additional hgb, hdl, ldl rows



- we can use the conv-net to predict ubalanced target, then add it to a df containing temperature and other details, then use a normal
lgbm to predict the next target variable



# MODELLING
- try normal conv-nets vs resnets
- data augmentation on spectral data(spectarl augmentations eg. spectral flipping or shifting)
- try spectrai


# Things to do when i get back to the hostel
- look at the new data, see if it can improve model accuracy
- try batch size of 2 etc
